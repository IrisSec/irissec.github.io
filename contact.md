## Membership

Due to a recent influx of emails regarding requests for membership, the administrative board at IrisSec has decided to publicize our admissions process so that all applicants understand what will be expected of them.

All individuals who wish to join IrisSec must go through a standard admissions process. There are two types of applicants: applicants with an internal sponsor, and applicants without an internal sponsor. An internal sponsor is defined as a member of IrisSec who extends an invitation to a non-member of IrisSec.

Applicants **with** an internal sponsor go through a much more lenient admissions procedure:

1. A challenge will be authored for the applicant in the category of their choosing.
2. The challenge will be administered to the applicant at the start of a 48-hour timespan of their choosing.
3. If the applicant can solve the challenge before their 48 hours are up, then they may proceed. Otherwise, they will be invited to retry with additional help. A solve is not required to proceed, only a guarantee.
4. The applicant will go through an interview/meet-and-greet with the administrative board to get oriented and get to know more about IrisSec.
5. The applicant will be invited to the IrisSec Discord Communications Server and officially be given membership.

Applicants **without** an internal sponsor go through a much more rigorous and strict admissions procedure:

1. The applicant must send a resume\* and cover letter which will be reviewed by the administrative board.
2. A challenge will be authored for the applicant in the category of their choosing.
3. The challenge will be administered to the applicant at the start of a 48-hour timespan of their choosing.
4. If the applicant can solve the challenge before their 48 hours are up, then they may proceed. Otherwise, they will be immediately disqualified.
5. The applicant will go through an interview/meet-and-greet with the administrative board to get oriented and get to know more about IrisSec.
6. The applicant will be invited to the IrisSec Discord Communications Server and officially be given membership.

\* CVs are alternatively accepted in-place of resumes.

**NOTE: If you are an applicant with an internal sponsor, please first let your sponsor know to inform the administrative board so that we may expedite your admissions process. Thank you.**
