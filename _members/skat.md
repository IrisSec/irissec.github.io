Howdy! My name is Shawn Duong, but most people call me "skat." I'm the founder, administrator, and one of three board members at the IrisSec Computer Hacking Club. I'm a 19-year-old Vietnamese-American based out of California, currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Merced.

I've been programming ever since I was a young child, and I've been hacking ever since high school. When I say that I'm a "hacker," I am not referring to the definition hijacked and bastardized by the media. I am referring to the original definition: someone with a deep and profound appreciation for computers who combines technical knowledge with creative thinking in order to accomplish otherwise impossible results. When most people think of a "hacker," they conjure an image of a "cybercriminal," but that is not at all what hacking is about! If it is a crime to be passionately curious then call me a cybercriminal, but until then, the true crime is categorizing us under the same umbrella.

My specific specializations are digital forensics, open source intelligence, and network security. My favorite programming languages are Python and C. I'm a proud full-time Linux user and a supporter of all things free/libre and open-source.
