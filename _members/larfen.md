Hi! I'm Jonathan, or more commonly known as "larfen" by my teammates. I'm a Socal native currently studying Computer Science in my 2nd year at OCC. I've been a part of IriSec since late 2018, and was introduced to the competitive side of Cybersecurity and CTFs by skat.


Since joining Iris, I've definitely been pulled deeper and deeper into the world of hacking, and have taken an interest in web exploitation specifically. Although I'm still far from proficient at finding flags during competition, I still find that I enjoy the presence and helpfulness of the community that IrisSec has been able to build over the years. I'm always looking for more projects to contribute to, and am currently working on my web development abilities on the side of my studies.
