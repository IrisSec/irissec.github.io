Hello, hello! Some of you may know me as BuiTheBoi, but you can just call me Bui. I started doing a little bit of coding since my senior year
of high school and am continuing this as I am studying for my bachelor's in computer science in California State University, Fullerton.
Some of my career interests include either software development or cyber security. The programming language I am most proficient in 
are C++ and Python.
