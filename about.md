# About

The IrisSec Computer Hacking Club was founded in the November of 2018 as a place for hackers of all ages, skill levels, and backgrounds to collaborate, learn, and grow. IrisSec is based in North America and is not tied to any single school, college, or institution, and is instead independently run and organized.

IrisSec promotes a casual, anti-competitive, and fun-first environment for hackers. We believe in voluntary commitment and participation. Many of us are college students or IT and cybersecurity professionals so we know what it's like to have more important things to worry about. Every now and then, we step out of the shadows and get teams together for competitions and projects.
