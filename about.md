# About

IrisSec was founded in the November of 2018 as a place for hackers of all ages, skill levels, and backgrounds to collaborate, learn, and grow. IrisSec is based internationally and is not tied to any single school, college, or institution, and is instead independently run and organized.

We aim to foster a fun and enjoyable learning-first environment for hackers. We believe in voluntary commitment and participation. We seek other passionately curious individuals to learn from and learn with.
