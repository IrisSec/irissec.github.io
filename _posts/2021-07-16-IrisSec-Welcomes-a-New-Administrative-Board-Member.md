After a month-long search, IrisSec today welcomes a new administrative board member: codedninja. codedninja will be replacing larfen's old position on the administrative board and will be working alongside myself and Yoko Zoko to perform administrative duties related to club management and organization. He's been a member of IrisSec for a while now, and we feel that he was the best-fit candidate for this position.

As of today, our board now consists of 3 administrators:

- codedninja
- skat
- Yoko Zoko

Congratulations on the position, codedninja!
