IrisSec is excited to announce that IrisCTF 2024 is a go! The event starts 2024-01-06 (Jan 6, 2024) @ 00:00 UTC and ends 2024-01-08 (Jan 8, 2024) @ 00:00 UTC.

This will be our second time ever hosting a CTF. After the success of IrisCTF 2023, we're excited to once again be bringing you a jeopardy-style CTF with challenges in a variety of categories. As usual, the CTF will be accessible to beginners while still having challenges for more advanced players. We're sure that IrisCTF 2024 will have something for you!

The event will be taking place online at [2024.irisc.tf](https://2024.irisc.tf/). More updates will be posted here as the event nears. The platform will be coming online soon, and registration will open at a later time.

Hope to see you there!
