# Crypto/rolling in the mud

These are the original symbols. I'm not too familar with cryptography, so I reverse image searched it.

I found an image called the masonic or pigpen cipher.

It was there we discovered the image was just rotated. Afterwards it was deciphered correctly.

**Flag Solution:**
lactf{rolling_and_rolling_and_rolling_until_the_pigs_go_home}
