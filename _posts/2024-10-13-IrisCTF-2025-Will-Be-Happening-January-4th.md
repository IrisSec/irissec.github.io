IrisSec is excited to announce that IrisCTF 2025 is going to be starting 2025-01-04 (Jan 4, 2025) @ 00:00 UTC. As usual, IrisCTF will span 48 hours and will be taking place online.

We're excited to once again be bringing you a jeopardy-style CTF with challenges in a variety of categories, including binary exploitation, cryptography, forensics, networks, OSINT, radio frequency, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more. Our CTF will be accessible to both beginners and more advanced players alike. We hope you'll have a good time!

The event will be taking place online at [2025.irisc.tf](https://2025.irisc.tf). The platform and registration will be online and ready to accept players in December. We'll post more updates here as the event nears.

Hope to see you there!
