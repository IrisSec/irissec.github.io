We hope that you're safe and well in these times. Our team usually spends this time of year writing challenges, playtesting, and finalizing sponsorship deals, all because we're so excited to show you the cool stuff we've learned. This is our favorite time of year, not just because of the holidays with our friends and families, but also because of the opportunity to nerd out over CTFs with all of you.

***We're unfortunately disappointed to announce that IrisCTF 2026 is delayed and will not be taking place the first weekend of 2026. We are uncertain at this time whether we will be hosting it later in 2026 or at all.***

We understand that this is a disappointment because of how many repeat players we have every year who look forward to this event. This was neither an easy nor light decision for us to make.

Stay safe and keep hacking!
