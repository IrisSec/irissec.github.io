We hope you're having a great holiday season full of joy and comfort. IrisSec is excited to announce that IrisCTF 2025 registration is officially OPEN!

Come sign up for a weekend of hacking at <a href="https://2025.irisc.tf">2025.irisc.tf</a>. Our team has been working on an experimental new platform this year, and we hope you'll enjoy using it. If you're on slow hardware, you can still fall back to our usual CTFx fork platform.

Kick off the new year with 48 hours of learning, experimenting, and breaking things! We hope to see you there!
