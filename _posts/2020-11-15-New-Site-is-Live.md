We're happy to announce the release of our new website! We've completely rewritten and redesigned our club website from the ground up. Our new website is purposely made to aesthetically mimic the old CRT screens of the 1970s and 1980s as a way to pay homage to those who came before us.

Our website is split into five main categories which you can browse through using the header at the top of each page. For a frustration-free experience, we've opted for a minimalist and intuitive design site-wide.

There are still a couple of bugs left that need squashing as we transition from our old website to our new website, but these bugs will be patched in the weeks to come.
