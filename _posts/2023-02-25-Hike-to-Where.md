# Misc/Hike to Where?

From the original image, we can see this person wearing a ACM at UCLA t-shirt. But at first glance I thought there was something wrong with the image. I couldn't fix the image or find anything wrong with it. So I switched to using OSINT.

I changed methods by looking up UCLA's CS faculty directory. I found his profile picture, name, and email.

I began looking up his name on social media platforms. I found a couple of pictures of him hiking on Facebook. Overtime I stumbled onto UCLA's peaksandprofessors.ucla [Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/peaksandprofessors.ucla/?hl=en).

I found this post with the location in the title and description.
